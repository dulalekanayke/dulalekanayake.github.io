**_Monday 15th November 2017_**

**_Simple coding_**

**_(SCRATCH)_**

**_What we learned_**

Today we went on scratch and we learned basic coding instructions. We took on skills like the  "move 10 steps" command-yeah! Pretty basic. We also learned how to make the program run a lot smoother by putting variables in and the repeat function.

**_What I did well and what I need to improve on_**

I listened well so that I could easily go back to my desk and do the work that i have been assigned to. I could, however take notes to my notebook more often in the case of me wanting to do the exercise again and REVISION! 

**_Simple scratch commands_** 

1) If touching red move -10 step

  Else move 0 steps

2) When spacebar pressed...

3) Move 10 steps

4) Go to (x-189,y-189)

5) Change costume to costume 2

6) change color effect by 25

AND WHEN YOU'RE A PRO

It should look like this:

1   when green flag clicked

2   forever loop()

3    if up arrow pressed

4     point in direction 180

5     move 10 steps

6     change costume

7      else:

8       if down arrow pressed

9        point in direction 0

10       move 10 steps

11       change costume

12        else:
