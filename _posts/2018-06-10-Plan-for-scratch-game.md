<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I didn't classify before lesson what genre of game i was going to do so I had to spend at least 15 minutes to verify what I was going to do, but I was left on a cliffhanger as I,but  in my brain I could not see how i would code something like that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To come up with an idea that would function and not be too complicated but fun.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, not really. I thought of a unique idea but the code was going to be hard to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>There is not really that much persevering in this project as you are planning or designing a game. Also it is quite impossible to give up as it is the sht easiest part of the season.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Here and again, you really can't question on designing a game as you can make it in any style or context and it won't matter as long as you are able to make the game when it comes to it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Well, i was really independent as I didn’t need assistance in the field of Independence. And really, it is quite easy to think of an idea, like mine that came in a matter of minutes in lesson.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td> When I was reflecting I came across many dilemmas that I could come over, making a combat platformer game that uses multiple variables. One of these examples is jumping as it will be very hard to make the jump smooth enough to make the character’s jump look realistic enough. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I could have maybe thought deeper and come up with an idea that would be much easier and more importantly, playable. </td>
