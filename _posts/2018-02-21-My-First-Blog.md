<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started not knowing what github could do and how to create a website. I wanted to learn more about designing websites hence my expectation for my future job.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I wanted to learn the basics of publishing and blogging on github.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>yes , by watching the tutorial on google slides, i managed to create a github page.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I did not give up, like when my code had an error - I simply went onto my github blog settings to see that the problem was on line 12, the line in which i import the URL of an image  to my 'config' page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the colour effects of the page by looking at the colour themes page that was put on the github help page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Most of the time I had to work independently, using my given resources (the internet) to figure things out, but occasionally I got the help of my partner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected by checking in my mind if everything is coded correctly, if the avatar for my page is the correct height and length and many more self thoughts. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I feel like I could have contributed more, instead of looking at the screen trying to improve my work, when the improvements were getting discussed the whole time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have definitely tried more things, for an example, I could have used more combinations to get the perfect colour mix. This would be effective because then the blog would look more appealing.  </td>
