<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Even though i have learned scratch before, I've always struggled with variables, for an example when have to add an operator(s) to subtract, add, multiply or divide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I want to be at an intermediate level when doing variables and want to be able to make a score for a game like ping pong. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not YET, but at home  im determined to succeed in variables.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In most cases I tend to avoid using variables as they most likely fail me and then I have to commit to troubleshooting which is a very long period of time in which I suffer, trying to figuring out what was wrong. But this time I persevered and (kind of got to my target)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Thing is I didn't really need to ask a question because I knew the basic idea or the concept of a variable command but I didn't know how to use it in the format of a ping pong game. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was quite independent as I didn’t need the aid of the teacher to, again, (kind of) get to my target.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>This is probably the thing that I did the most as I did fail with my variables at one point and then kept on trying to see what went wrong and what was to change.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Even though I love the simplicity of coding in scratch it is a total bummer when it comes to variables almost like a small spill of paint on a brilliant white paper.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I could have done was ask about the connection of the variables or how I could interlink the variables with some operators and sensors to make life easier then you can use the 'if touching colour’ in mix with the ‘ change points’</td>
    <td></td>
